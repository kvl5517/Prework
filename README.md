# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Kevin Lin**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Everything went successful while implementing the code by following the guide, however, after a few tries of restarting the simulator the Tap Gesture Recognizer stopped working, same issue still remains after creating a new project. The workaround was to switch between simulating devices, after switching from iPhone 12 Pro to 11 Pro Max the Recognizer started working again without changing the context in the code. 

I wanted to try out some of the optional features, however, I couldn't get the slider to work with the Tip Control to show the current Tip Percentage after numerous tries, so decided not to include it. I'll be finding videos online to learn how to develop a better software using Xcode than the one I completed here.
